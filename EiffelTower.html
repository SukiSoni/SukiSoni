    <p style="background-color:lightblue"><font size="4"> The Eiffel Tower is the most iconic structure of Paris. The wrought iron lattice tower designed by  Gustave Eiffel, stands at 324metres high with 3 floors open to visitors. The lower two floors contain high quality restaurants while the top floor is an observation deck.    The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually only accessible by lift.</font></p>
    
    <p style="background-color:lightblue"><font size="4"> More than 250 million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889. In 2015, there were 6.91 million visitors. The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world. An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues. Tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues. It is located at Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, Fr<img src="../Downloads/eiffel-tower-view-3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="260" align="right"/>ance.</font></p>

    <p style="background-color:lightblue"> <font size="4">It is also the stage for numerous events of international significance such as light shows, the Tower’s centenary, the Year 2000 pyrotechnic show,  the blue Tower to mark France’s Presidency of the European Union or the multicoloured Tower for its 120th birthday</font></p>
    
    <p style="background-color:lightblue"> <font size="4">Constrution of the Eiffel Tower began in 28 January 1887 and after two years was finished on 15 March 1889. Many people object to the constrution of the tower, saying it would be a useless project but now it is a cultural landmark of France.  </font></p>
