    <p style="background-color:darkblue"> <font size="4">Notre Dame is a medieval Catholic cathedral considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture, and is among the largest and most well-known church buildings in the world. The cathedral was among the first buildings in the world to use the flying buttress. The building was not originally designed to include the flying buttresses around the choir and nave but after the construction began, the thinner walls grew ever higher and stress fractures began to occur as the walls pushed outward. In response, the cathedral's architects built supports around the outside walls, and later additions continued the pattern. The total surface area is 5,500mÂ² . </font> </p>

    <p style="background-color:darkblue"><font size="4">The cathedral has 10 bells. The largest, Emmanuel, original to 1681, is located in the south tower and weighs just over 13 tons and is tolled to mark the hours of the day and for various occasions and services. This bell is always rung first, at least 5 seconds before the rest.</font></p>
